Alpha Speed is a project created for our systems development course.
The theme of this project is a concessionaire, in which we use HTML, CSS & JavaScript, and soon we will use more elements and languages on this page.

With HTML:
- We create the pages and connect them to each other;
- We put the links for redirects;
- And we added the images;

With CSS:
- We styled these pages;
- And we create pseudocodes for further decoration in specific elements;

With JavaScript:
- Create the slide carousel and functions;
- Create the cadastro screen functional and login screen functional;
- Create the button back to top;
- Create the mobile nav;
- Create the localization dinamic and most more in footer mobile;
- Create the cars showcase dinamic and filter;
